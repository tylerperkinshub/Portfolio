Hi my name is Tyler Perkins. I am a Junior iOS Developer. I have been taking classes with the Iron Yard since July 2016. In this time I have been exposed to major concepts in Objective-C like modeling, basic networking, core data, location services, mapping. In Swift I have covered the Objective-C conepts listed previous plus animations, spritekit, custom drawing, and cloud services.
