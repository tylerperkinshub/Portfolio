I am a Junior iOS Developer. I have been taking classes with the Iron Yard since July 2016. In this time I have been exposed to major concepts in Objective-C like modeling, basic networking, core data, location services, mapping. In Swift I have covered the Objective-C conepts listed previous plus animations, spritekit, custom drawing, and cloud services. 

### Movie Mania 

This app was mode to keep track of movies you might have seen in 2016. It features a collection of sorted movies that you are able to read further information pulled from the Open Movie Database and then add any movies you might want to see to a list.

### SwiftMomentOfClarity

This is an app to keep your mental acumen up to par with what work you are doing. I found myself getting overly stressed by code and found if I ttok sometime to unwind my brain it would help with the task at hand. 


### SwiftSimon

This app is a recreation of the childhood favorite Simon. You will need to memorize the order in which colors animate and make noise or else suffer the torment of a low score.
